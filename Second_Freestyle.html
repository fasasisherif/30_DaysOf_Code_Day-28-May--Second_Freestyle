  <div class="about">MY JOURNEY SO FAR</div>
  <section class="one0">
    <div class="one1">Joining ECX</div>
    <div>In my first class, we were taught the fundamentals of Html. It was exciting and interesting even though I had already started learning myself before that time. The tutors are really amazing.</div>
    
    <div class="one1">Other <span>Xperience</span></div>
    <div>There was a time when Geektutor shared jotters a for those who did the assignment. I also remember when we played Kahoot and someone with nickname 'Mad ooo' won. To sum it, I love the xperience</div>
    
     <div class="one1">Previous 30 Days of Code</div>
    <div>The previous 30 Days of Code was chilling. It was really challenging. Both the tasks given and the challenge with electricity. I was unable to complete it. But I did try.</div>

  <div class="about">Present 30 Days of Code</div>
  <section>
    <div class="one1">Day 1</div>
    <div>I started this with renewed enthusiasm, that if I couldn't finish the last one, I must finish this one.</div>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <div class="one1">Day 3</div>
    <div>I'm still with the enthusiasm and I still have the energy. I sleep late, wake up at night. To make sure that I don't carry over any task. I was able to do that only for some time.</div>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <div class="one1">Day 15</div>
    <div>My energy has declined with my enthusiasm and I've already carried over more than five tasks. But I continue to push myself and sometimes I start thinking of quiting.</div>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <div class="one1">Day 20</div>
    <div>Right now I want to quit. I remember that on this Day 20, I purposely did not do like three days straight. I already have a train of undone tasks that keeps piling. I got tired of coding. I was like, at least I did better than last challenge. At this point, I really thought of quiting.</div>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <div class="one1">Day 30</div>
    <div>I was able to motivate myself and others also thought I should continue since it's just a few days remaining. So I continue and I'm proud of where I've gotten today.</div>
